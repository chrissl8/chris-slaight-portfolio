 			<h1>Welcome</h1>
 			<p>Web Developer known as Chris Slaight, born and raised in Staten Island, New York. Currently working in the world of software support, ready to make a career change into software development. Outside of work, I generally like to spend time with my girlfriend, family and friends in whatever adventures that we find ourselves in.</p>

 			<h1>Interests</h1>
 			<p>Generally I enjoy going out with my girlfriend, lounging around with friends, travelling/driving/exploring new and interesting places, writing code, going to the beach or in the pool, drawing, photography, aviation, transportation, cars, automotive detailing and exploring New York City to name a few.</p>
 			<h1>Dream Job?</h1>
 			<p>My dream job would be to work as a senior software engineer or architect leading a development department for a rising software start-up.</p>
 			<h1>Most Important Thing</h1>
 			<p>Being happy and satisfied about what you do in life is very important to me, maybe not being happy every minute of every day but at least feeling like you're doing something you enjoy and making a difference.</p>
